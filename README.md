# Smaller-Face-Shield

This was based off an existing laser cut file, but modified to use 8-1/2" x 11" Transparencies 

Cut the Face Shield V2 Brackets out of 1/4" (6mm) material.

Cut the Transparency V7 file from the plastic film.

Use 1/16" or 1/8" Shock Cord for the strap.  Cut to 20".  Thread through the holes on the brackets and tie off with a knot.  

Strap adjusters are a nice feature- these were cut from 1/32" (0.8mm) Polypropylene Sheet.  Thread the 1/16" cord through the adjuster before tying off on the bracket.  Modify the size of the holes to fit whichever cord you are using.
